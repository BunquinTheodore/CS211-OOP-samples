## üëãüèª Greetings!
Welcome to the **CS 211 - Object-oriented Programming** course! ‚òïüß°<br>

This course will establish an object-oriented mindset and to gain valuable insights into how software can be developed using the object-oriented approaches, the separation of design from implementation, and describe the concepts using diagrams. This course should not be interpreted to be a pure programming language course. Rather, the programming language serves to illustrate, via practical examples, the concepts learnt in the course.
